# MaxNonoverlappingSegments
# Find a maximal set of non-overlapping segments.

# Located on a line are N segments, numbered from 0 to N − 1, whose positions are given in arrays A and B. For each I (0 ≤ I < N) the position of segment I is from A[I] to B[I] (inclusive). The segments are sorted by their ends, which means that B[K] ≤ B[K + 1] for K such that 0 ≤ K < N − 1.

# Two segments I and J, such that I ≠ J, are overlapping if they share at least one common point. In other words, A[I] ≤ A[J] ≤ B[I] or A[J] ≤ A[I] ≤ B[J].

# We say that the set of segments is non-overlapping if it contains no two overlapping segments. The goal is to find the size of a non-overlapping set containing the maximal number of segments.

# For example, consider arrays A, B such that:

#     A[0] = 1    B[0] = 5
#     A[1] = 3    B[1] = 6
#     A[2] = 7    B[2] = 8
#     A[3] = 9    B[3] = 9
#     A[4] = 9    B[4] = 10
# The segments are shown in the figure below.

# The size of a non-overlapping set containing a maximal number of segments is 3. For example, possible sets are {0, 2, 3}, {0, 2, 4}, {1, 2, 3} or {1, 2, 4}. There is no non-overlapping set with four segments.

# Write a function:

# def solution(A, B)

# that, given two arrays A and B consisting of N integers, returns the size of a non-overlapping set containing a maximal number of segments.

# For example, given arrays A, B shown above, the function should return 3, as explained above.

# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N is an integer within the range [0..30,000];
# each element of arrays A, B is an integer within the range [0..1,000,000,000];
# A[I] ≤ B[I], for each I (0 ≤ I < N);
# B[K] ≤ B[K + 1], for each K (0 ≤ K < N − 1).

    for i in range(len(A)):
